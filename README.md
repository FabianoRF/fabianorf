# Fabiano Reis Faleiros

## Hi :wave:

Hi, I’m Fabiano, a developer with over 4 years of experience in building scalable and efficient solutions. I work with technologies like TypeScript, Angular, React, Node.js, Express, NestJS, SQL, Redis, and various AWS services, including S3, EC2, RDS, SNS, SQS, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

Throughout my career, I have worked with startups and large companies, developing products that optimize processes and enhance user experience. I’m a strong advocate of clean code, automated testing, and agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.
